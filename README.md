üå∏ Transform the ordinary into the extraordinary üå∏

Fueled by curiosity, I have always been fascinated by computers and the creation of beautiful, intuitive websites. After completing my training at Becode.org, where I refined my web development skills and strengthened my self-learning and teamwork abilities, I began an internship at Webecode. This valuable experience has allowed me to further develop my technical expertise in a professional environment. As my internship comes to an end, I am now actively seeking a full-time position where I can continue to bring my creativity and dedication to new challenges. I thrive on creating work that brings that "wow" factor to users' faces, and I'm excited to contribute to innovative projects that inspire.
